# Challenge 1
vagrant is a very cheap way to spin up a 3 tiered system whilst still having easy access a "full" server for a traditional approach.

Auto discovery is installed and enabled to aide in DNS resolution. This means you don't have to configure DNS or have some fancy vagrant plugin. Try `ping web.local`, `ping database.local`, or `ping app.local` from any of the servers.
